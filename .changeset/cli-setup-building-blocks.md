Adapters can declare `setup`: the environment variable for each credential and config setting, a description, and a link to where a person gets it when there is one. `alternatives` lists credentials that stand in for each other (exe.dev takes an API key or an SSH key). Every official adapter now declares its own, and the CLI reads them from the installed adapter instead of keeping its own table, so third-party adapters that declare `setup` get environment-only settings too. Missing-setting errors and `beachside providers` link to where each value comes from, and `providers` lists the profiles that use each provider. Its JSON rows add `known` (false when the adapter failed to load or declares no setup, in which case `missingEnv` is empty and the text says the settings are unknown) and `needs`, with each missing value's description and link.

New `beachside profile ls | show | use | rm` commands list profiles, explain where each setting comes from without revealing credentials, change the default and remove profiles. `profile show` reports `ready` (true, false, or null when the adapter declares no setup) and what the profile still `needs`. `use` and `rm` rewrite `beachside.json` atomically under a lock, keeping its file mode. `profile rm` refuses while stored sandboxes, snapshots or images use the profile, unless `--force`.

`beachside.json` has a published JSON Schema (https://beachside.run/schema/beachside.json, also printed by `beachside schema config`), and the file accepts a `$schema` key so editors can complete and check it. The schema requires each profile to name a `provider` or a `module`.

`beachside doctor` now checks that the provider accepts the credentials with one read of its sandbox listing. A rejected key exits 5 (`UNAUTHENTICATED` or `FORBIDDEN`) with the profile name and where to get a new key, here and on any command that connects, instead of an internal error with an unknown outcome.

`beachside providers` no longer marks boxd and Freestyle experimental, and lists providers in the docs' order.
